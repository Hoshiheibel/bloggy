Bloggy
======

Small and lightweight markdown blog engine for node.js.

The code is checked with jslint and tested with mocha. You can use the grunt task to generate the code coverage. Just enter `grunt` at the command prompt.

**Currently the documentation is incomplete!**

Folder structure
----------------

The blog content has to use the following folder structure.

- content
    - 2013-11-21-18-30
        - meta.json
        - content.md
    - 2013-12-8-9-45
        - meta.json
        - content.md
    - ...

The folder names below the main "content" folder are used as identifier and publishing date of the article. Use the format "year-month-day-hour-minute".

Metadata (meta.json)
--------------------

```JSON
{
    "longTitle": "Title of the blog entry",
    "shortTitle": "entry1",
    "tags": ["tech", "node", "markdown"]
}
```

- The longTitle and shortTitle has to be unique.
- The shortTitle can be used for a url shortener like functionality.
- The tags are case sensitive.

Setup
-----

```Javascript
var path = require('path'),
    bloggy = require('bloggy'),
    engine = bloggy();

...

engine.setup({
    baseDirectory: path.join(__dirname, 'content'),
    urls: {
        base: 'http://mspi.es',
        feed: 'http://mspi.es/feed',
        favicon: 'http://mspi.es/favicon.ico',
        entry: 'http://mspi.es/blog/{slug}',
        images: 'http://mspi.es/images/blog/{imageUrl}'
    },
    feed: {
        author: 'Marcell Spies',
        title: 'Marcell Spies - Developers Diary',
        description: 'some description',
        copyright: 'Â© Marcell Spies',
        language: 'de',
        ttl: 30
    }
});

...

engine.load(function () {
    // The engine is ready now
    // Run your web framework or do other stuff with it
});

```

Blog entry
----------

The structure of a blog entry:

```Javascript
{
    id: '2014-10-04-20-30',
    entryPath: '/var/www/myblog/content/2014-10-04-20-30',
    contentPath: '/var/www/myblog/content/2014-10-04-20-30/content.md',
    metaPath: '/var/www/myblog/content/2014-10-04-20-30/meta.json',
    shortTitle: 'travisdeploy',
    longTitle: 'How to deploy to Travis-CI',
    url: 'http://mspi.es/blog/How-to-deploy-to-Travis-CI',
    date: new Date(2014, 09, 04, 20, 30),
    slug: 'How-to-deploy-to-Travis-CI',
    tags: [ 
        { name: 'tech', slug: 'tech'}, 
        { name: 'Continiuous Integration', slug: 'Continuous-Integration'}]
    content: '<h2>...</h2>' /* content is only available, when you have loaded it */
}
```

Every entry contains a `load()` method with callback, which is called after its content has been loaded. This content is cached as long as you hold a reference to this blog entry object.

```Javascript
entry.load(function () {
    var content = entry.content;
});
```

Engine functions
----------------

The engine contains the following functions.


**Get all blog entries (ordered by name)**

```Javascript
var entries = engine.entries.all.orderedByName();
```

**Get all blog entries (ordered by date [descending])**

```Javascript
var entries = engine.entries.all.orderedByDate();
```

**Get entries containing a specific tag slug**

```Javascript
var entries = engine.entries.byTagSlug('Continuous-Integration');
```

**Get one entry by its slug**

```Javascript
var entry = engine.entry.bySlug('How-to-deploy-to-Travis-CI');
```

**Get one entry by its short title**

```Javascript
var entry = engine.entry.byShortTitle('travisdeploy');
```

**Get the latest/newest entry**

```Javascript
var entry = engine.entry.latest();
```

**Get all tags (ordered by the number of usages)**

```Javascript
var tags = engine.tags.all();

[
    { count: 5, tag: { name: 'tech', slug: 'tech'} },
    { count: 4, tag: { name: 'nodejs', slug: 'nodejs'} },
    { count: 1, tag: { name: 'Continuous Integration', slug: 'Continuous-Integration'} },
]
```

**Get all tags names**

```Javascript
var tagNames = engine.tags.asNames();

['tech', 'nodejs', 'Continuous Integration']
```

**Load the content of multiple entries**

After executing, you have access to the content property of each entry.

```Javascript
engine.entries.load(entries, function() {
    entries.forEach(function (entry) {
        var content = entry.content;
    });
});
```
