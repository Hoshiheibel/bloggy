Bloggy
======

Small and lightweight markdown blog engine for node.js.

** Currently the documentation is incomplete! **

Folder structure
----------------

The blog content has to use the following folder structure.

- content
    - 2013-11-21-18-30
        - meta.json
        - content.md
    - 2013-12-8-9-45
        - meta.json
        - content.json
    - ...

Metadata (meta.json)
--------------------

```JSON
{
    "longTitle": "Title of the blog entry",
    "shortTitle": "entry1",
    "tags": ["tech", "node", "markdown"]
}
```

- The longTitle and shortTitle has to be unique.
- The shortTitle can be used for a url shortener like functionality.
- The tags are case sensitive.
